# PyLan-Public
------------------------------------------------
### Latest Setup
<p>To download the installer go here: https://github.com/User000K/PyLan-Public/releases/tag/setup
Alternatively you many download this repository and manually setup PyLan</p>

#### Known Bugs:
- PyLan.exe does not close fully properly, it still runs in the background processes, using up valuable memory space. And needs to be closed either by taskmgr or powertoys.filelocksmith or any other program that can terminate the process (Note: there can be more than one process running).
